Memory Management is a critical aspect of Operating systems that ensures efficient use of the computer's memory resources.
It controls how memory is allocated and deallocated to processes, which is key to both performance and stability.

Registers <-> Cache <-> Main Memory <-> Electronic Disk <-> Magnetic Disk <-> Optical Disks <-> Magnetic Disks

** Why Memory management is required ?
-> Allocate and de-allocate memory before and after process execution.
-> To keep track of used memory space by processes.
-> To minimize fragmentation issues.
-> To proper utilization of main memory.
-> To maintain data integrity while execution of process.

Logical and Physical Address Space

* Logical Address Space : is the set of all addresses that a process can generate using its CPU. It defines the range of memory locations available to the process from its perspective.

* Physical Address Space : is the set of all actual memory addresses in main memory (RAM). It represents real locations where data and instructions are stored.
