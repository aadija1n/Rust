Rust is a Programming Language which advances safety, speed, and performance all at the same time with multithreading support.
Unlike other programming languages Null pointer dereferencing and race condition are No longer and issue in Rust.

Created by Graydon Hoare (2006) -> Sponsored by Mozilla (2009) -> Released in 2015.

Advantages of Rust :
* High Performance - As fast as C/C++ with zero-cost abstractions.
* Memory safety - No garbage collector, yet prevents memory leaks using ownership and borrowing.
* Concurrency without fear - Built-in safeguards to make multithreading safe and efficient.
* Growing popularity - Used by Microsoft, AWS, etc.

Rust vs Others
* Rust vs C++ : Offers same speed but wth better Safety guarantees.
* Rust vs Go : Both focus on concurrency, But Rust provides finer control over system resources.
* Rust vs Python : Rust is much faster, While python is easier.

** Prerequisites Before Learning Rust **
-> Basic Programming Concepts.
-> Memory Management.
-> C/C++ Concepts.
