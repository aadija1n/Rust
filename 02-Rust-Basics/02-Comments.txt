Comments are lines in the code that are ignored by the compiler. They are used to explain the code and make it more readable. In Rust, comments start with two forward slashes //.

There are two types of comments in Rust:

Single-line comments: These comments start with // and continue to the end of the line.
Multi-line comments: These comments start with /* and end with */. They can span multiple lines.
